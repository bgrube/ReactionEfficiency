# Study of the proton-track reconstruction efficiency at GlueX using $\gamma~p \to \pi^+\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-~p_\text{miss}$ events

The analysis is based on PART files that are generated by the `ReactionEfficiency` plugin in [halld_recon](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/halld_recon) (needs at least commit [257a47e](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/halld_recon/tree/257a47e78362d814957cf1d6d09be3c675a1432b/src/plugins/Analysis/ReactionEfficiency); see also [PR #739](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/halld_recon/pull/739)). Scripts to run the plugin reside in `launchPlugin`.

The PART files are further processed by `DSelector_pippippimpimpmiss.{h,C}`, which is run over the data by `runSelector.py`. Currently, the produced custom ROOT trees need to be further processed by `makeBruFitTree.py`, which produces `.root.brufit` files.

These files contain the trees from which missing-mass squared distributions are generated. The proton peak in these distributions is fit using histogram-based shapes for signal and background that are extracted from `bggen` Monte Carlo. `runFits.py` is the master script that performs these fits and produces `.pdf` files with the result plots.

The fits are based on the [BruFit](https://github.com/dglazier/brufit) package, which bins the data and performs the fits in the kinematic bins using [RooFit](https://root.cern/manual/roofit/). Currently, the [`boot` branch](https://github.com/dglazier/brufit/tree/boot) and ROOT version 6.28 or higher are needed to run the fits.
